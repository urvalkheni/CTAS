Bathymetric surveys reveal a 0.8m scour trench adjacent to the groin field, likely due to wave-induced turbulence during recent high energy events.

    sample: "The shoreline is experiencing erosion at a rate of about 2 meters per year. This is happening because of stronger waves reaching the coast during storms and the rising sea levels. Our monitoring shows that during high tides, water levels are now reaching areas that were previously dry, which increases flooding risk. The most vulnerable areas are the low-lying sections near the inlet where wave energy is concentrated."

    sample: "The beach is washing away faster than normal, losing about 6 feet of sand each year. During storms, waves are coming higher up the beach than they used to, sometimes reaching the dunes. This means homes near the beach could face more flooding during big storms. The most at-risk areas are near the inlet, where waves are stronger. We recommend keeping at least 100 feet away from eroding dune edges during storms."

Do not drive through flooded roads. Monitor emergency channels for evacuation notices. Conditions will be worst between 8:00-11:00 PM during high tide."
