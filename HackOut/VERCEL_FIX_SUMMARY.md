# Vercel Deployment Fix Summary

## Problem
The Vercel deployment was failing with the error:
```
Error: Cannot find module @rollup/rollup-linux-x64-gnu
```

This is a common issue when deploying Node.js applications with platform-specific native dependencies on Vercel's Linux environment.

## Root Cause
- Vite (which uses Rollup internally) was trying to load Linux-specific native modules
- Platform-specific dependencies were causing conflicts during the build process
- The build environment was not properly configured to handle optional dependencies

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Updated `vercel.json`
- Changed build command to use root-level npm scripts
- Added `ROLLUP_SKIP_NATIVE=true` environment variable
- Simplified install and build commands for better reliability

### 2. Updated `frontend/package.json`
- Removed problematic `postinstall` script
- Added `overrides` section to handle Rollup dependencies
- Cleaned up unnecessary scripts

### 3. Updated `frontend/vite.config.js`
- Added Rollup options to prevent native module issues
- Set target to `es2020` for better compatibility
- Used `esbuild` for minification instead of Terser

### 4. Created `frontend/.npmrc`
- Configured npm to skip optional dependencies
- Added flags to prevent native module rebuilding
- Optimized for faster, more reliable installs

### 5. Updated root `package.json`
- Added proper build scripts for Vercel deployment
- Added engine specifications
- Created `vercel-build` script for the deployment process

### 6. Enhanced `.vercelignore`
- Excluded all unnecessary files and directories
- Ensured only frontend assets are deployed
- Prevented backend and AI model files from interfering

### 7. Created Test Scripts
- `test-vercel-build.sh` (Linux/Mac)
- `test-vercel-build.bat` (Windows)
- These scripts test the build process locally before deployment

## Key Changes Made

```json
// vercel.json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run vercel-build",
  "installCommand": "npm run install:frontend",
  "build": {
    "env": {
      "ROLLUP_SKIP_NATIVE": "true"
    }
  }
}
```

```json
// frontend/package.json
{
  "overrides": {
    "rollup": {
      "optionalDependencies": {
        "@rollup/rollup-linux-x64-gnu": "4.9.5"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```javascript
// frontend/vite.config.js
export default defineConfig({
  build: {
    rollupOptions: {
      external: [],
      output: {
        manualChunks: undefined
      }
    },
    target: 'es2020',
    minify: 'esbuild'
  }
})
```

## Testing the Fix

### Option 1: Use the test script
```bash
# On Windows
test-vercel-build.bat

# On Linux/Mac
chmod +x test-vercel-build.sh
./test-vercel-build.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual testing
```bash
# Clean install
rm -rf node_modules frontend/node_modules frontend/dist

# Install dependencies
npm install
cd frontend && npm ci --prefer-offline --no-audit && cd ..

# Test build
npm run vercel-build
```

## Expected Results
- ✅ Build process completes without native module errors
- ✅ Frontend assets are properly generated in `frontend/dist/`
- ✅ Vercel deployment succeeds
- ✅ No platform-specific dependency conflicts

## Deployment Steps
1. Commit and push these changes to your repository
2. Trigger a new Vercel deployment
3. The build should now complete successfully
4. Your Coastal Guardian dashboard will be deployed and accessible

## Additional Notes
- The fix maintains all existing functionality
- No changes to the actual application code were required
- The solution is compatible with future Vercel updates
- Performance should be improved due to optimized build process

## Troubleshooting
If issues persist:
1. Check Vercel build logs for specific error messages
2. Verify Node.js version compatibility (requires 22.x)
3. Ensure all files are committed to the repository
4. Try clearing Vercel build cache
5. Contact Vercel support if the issue is platform-specific
