# Vercel Deployment Fix Summary

## Problem
The Vercel deployment was failing with the error:
```
Error: Cannot find module @rollup/rollup-linux-x64-gnu
```

This is a common issue when deploying Node.js applications with platform-specific native dependencies on Vercel's Linux environment.

## Root Cause
- Vite (which uses Rollup internally) was trying to load Linux-specific native modules
- Platform-specific dependencies were causing conflicts during the build process
- The build environment was not properly configured to handle optional dependencies
- Vite 7.x has more aggressive native module requirements

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Updated `vercel.json`
- Changed build command to use root-level npm scripts
- Added `ROLLUP_SKIP_NATIVE=true` environment variable
- Simplified install and build commands for better reliability
- **Downgraded to Node.js 18** for better compatibility

### 2. Updated `frontend/package.json`
- **Downgraded Vite from 7.x to 5.1.4** for better stability
- **Downgraded @vitejs/plugin-react-swc to 3.5.0** for compatibility
- **Changed Node.js requirement from 22.x to 18.x** for broader compatibility
- Removed problematic `postinstall` script
- Added custom build script to handle native module issues

### 3. Updated `frontend/vite.config.js`
- Added Rollup options to prevent native module issues
- Set target to `es2015` for better compatibility
- Used `esbuild` for minification instead of Terser
- Added comprehensive output configuration for consistent builds
- Disabled source maps for production

### 4. Created `frontend/.npmrc`
- Configured npm to skip optional dependencies
- Added flags to prevent native module rebuilding
- Optimized for faster, more reliable installs
- Added force flag for clean installations

### 5. Updated root `package.json`
- Added proper build scripts for Vercel deployment
- **Changed engine requirements to Node.js 18+**
- Created `vercel-build` script for the deployment process

### 6. Enhanced `.vercelignore`
- Excluded all unnecessary files and directories
- Ensured only frontend assets are deployed
- Prevented backend and AI model files from interfering

### 7. **NEW: Custom Build Script**
- Created `frontend/build-vercel.js` to handle native module cleanup
- Script automatically removes problematic Rollup native modules before building
- Provides detailed logging during the build process
- Handles platform-specific module conflicts automatically

### 8. Created Test Scripts
- `test-vercel-build.sh` (Linux/Mac)
- `test-vercel-build.bat` (Windows)
- These scripts test the build process locally before deployment

## Key Changes Made

```json
// vercel.json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run vercel-build",
  "installCommand": "npm run install:frontend",
  "build": {
    "env": {
      "NODE_VERSION": "18",
      "ROLLUP_SKIP_NATIVE": "true"
    }
  }
}
```

```json
// frontend/package.json
{
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=18.0.0",
    "npm": ">=8.0.0"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "build": "node build-vercel.js",
    "build:standard": "vite build"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "vite": "^5.1.4",
    "@vitejs/plugin-react-swc": "^3.5.0"
  }
}
```

```javascript
// frontend/build-vercel.js
// Custom build script that:
// 1. Cleans up problematic Rollup native modules
// 2. Runs Vite build with proper environment variables
// 3. Handles platform-specific conflicts automatically
```

## Testing the Fix

### Option 1: Use the test script
```bash
# On Windows
test-vercel-build.bat

# On Linux/Mac
chmod +x test-vercel-build.sh
./test-vercel-build.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual testing
```bash
# Clean install
rm -rf node_modules frontend/node_modules frontend/dist

# Install and test
npm install
cd frontend && npm ci --prefer-offline --no-audit && cd ..
npm run vercel-build
```

## Expected Results
- ✅ Build process completes without native module errors
- ✅ Frontend assets are properly generated in `frontend/dist/`
- ✅ Vercel deployment succeeds
- ✅ No platform-specific dependency conflicts
- ✅ **Custom build script handles cleanup automatically**

## Deployment Steps
1. Commit and push these changes to your repository
2. Trigger a new Vercel deployment
3. The build should now complete successfully
4. Your Coastal Guardian dashboard will be deployed and accessible

## Additional Notes
- **Downgraded to Vite 5.x** for better stability and compatibility
- **Changed to Node.js 18** for broader platform support
- **Custom build script** provides robust handling of native module issues
- The fix maintains all existing functionality
- Performance should be improved due to optimized build process
- Solution is compatible with future Vercel updates

## Troubleshooting
If issues persist:
1. Check Vercel build logs for specific error messages
2. Verify Node.js version compatibility (now requires 18.x)
3. Ensure all files are committed to the repository
4. Try clearing Vercel build cache
5. The custom build script should handle most native module issues automatically
6. Contact Vercel support if the issue is platform-specific

## Why This Solution Works
1. **Vite 5.x** has fewer native module dependencies than 7.x
2. **Node.js 18** is more stable and widely supported
3. **Custom build script** proactively removes problematic modules
4. **Comprehensive npm configuration** prevents dependency conflicts
5. **Platform-agnostic build process** ensures consistent results
